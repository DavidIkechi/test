                <h2>Constance Wu Says She Experienced 'Sexual Harassment and Intimidation' by Fresh Off the Boat Producer</h2>
               </div>
               <p>Wu also clarified her 2019 tweet about the ABC show's renewal, explaining, "I wanted to have a fresh slate where I didn't have to start a show with all these memories of abuse"</p>
               <p>Constance Wu is speaking out about her troubling experience working on Fresh Off the Boat.

                In a conversation with The Atlantic on Friday to promote her new book Making a Scene, the actress, 40, revealed that she faced "sexual harassment and intimidation" on the set of the ABC sitcom by one of the show's producers.
                
                Though she was uncomfortable with the situation, Wu said she did not come forward with the story at the time in order to protect the show and its impact on the Asian American community.
                
                Reps for ABC did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
                
                "My publisher really encouraged me to write [about] it ... I was like, 'No I'm done with that chapter in my life,'" Wu recalled on stage to The Atlantic's reporter. "And then I eventually realized it was important to talk about because I did have a pretty traumatic experience my first couple years on that show, and nobody knew about it because that show was historic for Asian Americans."
                
                "It was the only show on network television in over 20 years to star Asian Americans, and I did not want to sully the reputation of the one show we had representing us," she continued. "I kept my mouth shut for a really long time about a lot of sexual harassment and intimidation that I received the first two seasons of the show."
                
                Once the show became "a success" on ABC, the Crazy Rich Asians star said she felt a sense of confidence to say "no" to the unidentified producer.
                
                "I was no longer scared of losing my job," she explained. "That's when I was able to start saying 'no' to the harassment, 'no' to the intimidation, from this particular producer. And, so I thought, 'You know what? I handled it, nobody has to know, I don't have to stain this Asian American producer's reputation, I don't have to stain the reputation of the show.'"</p>
